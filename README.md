Bitcoin Financial Analysis for Arbitrage

 A Jupyter Notebook that is sorting through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. The program will be conducting a Financial Analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin, from January 2018 to April 2018.

Please be sure to install all the prerequisites (libraries) before running the program:

- `pip install pandas`

The other libraries, **pathlib** should be installed by default. If not, run: ` pip install pathlib `.
The code is using **matplotlib** to implement visualizations/ploting into the program.
